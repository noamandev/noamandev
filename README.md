ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m: /br/
"PuppetMarion" on most socials. Im a student in India and I work on art projects with various goals in mind :) /br/
ðŸ‘€ Im a: /br/
3D artist who mostly does work on animation, modelling and hand painting. I've been trying to learn about modular asset workflows and procedural modelling and texturing. /br/
ðŸŒ± The software I use are: /br/
Blender for 3D, Davinci for video editing, Audacity for sound editing, and Krita for concept art. I also use PureRef in case I need a place to store all my references.
